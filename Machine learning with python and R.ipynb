    "- Machine learning is a class of algorithms which are data driven\n",
    "    - Unlike normal algorithms it is the data that indicates what the optimum/target answer is\n",
    "- Getting computers to program themselves by creating an algorithm to make decisions using data  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features of ML\n",
    "- Uses the data to detect patterns in a dataset, and adjust the program accordingly\n",
    "- Develops programs that can teach themselvees to grow and change when exposed to new data\n",
    "- Enables computers to find hidden insights, using iterative algorithms without being explicitly programmed\n",
    "- Automates analytical model building  \n",
